   - Phase 1 Functional
   - Phase 1 Technical
3. All links are working and point to correct pages
4. All pages have consistent styling (using ../styles.css from mockups)
5. Navigation breadcrumbs allow easy back/forward movement

### How to Verify Everything Works
1. Open https://naimishkathrani-web.github.io/RevNova/
2. Click "Requirements" in top navigation - should see dropdown
3. Click "Product Vision" - should load vision page with 5-phase timeline
4. Click "Business Requirements" - should load stakeholder table and business rules
5. Click "Field Mapping" - should see 5 workstream tables (WS1-WS5)
6. Click "Phase 1 Functional" - should see wizard pages and 24 business rules
7. Click "Phase 1 Technical" - should see 40+ API endpoints and database schema

### If Links Don't Work
- Wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub Pages build to complete
- Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+F5)
- Check GitHub Actions tab in repository for deployment status
- Verify main branch has all commits (407ac58, 41518b2, 54e52bb)
