⚠️ Key Migration Challenges & Considerations
From industry articles and LinkedIn posts, here are major obstacles your architecture team must plan for — I’ve summarized and elaborated them for clarity.
1. Architectural Paradigm Shift
The migration from the managed-package architecture of CPQ to the native architecture of Salesforce Revenue Cloud (RCA) involves major changes: data model, API semantics, subscription lifecycle, pricing engine.
“Architectural Paradigm Shift” listed as #1 in migrating from CPQ to RCA. LinkedIn
Impacts:
•	Existing CPQ customizations (plugins, triggers, libraries) may not translate easily.
•	The way bundles, options, pricing rules, and subscriptions are handled changes.
•	Data model differences may force re-design rather than lift-and-shift.
Mitigation: Perform a full architecture fit-gap early, map each object/field, highlight where business logic will need re-engineering.
2. Product & Pricing Model Complexity
Days where product/price models were simple are gone. Modern questions: multi-dimensional pricing, usage charges, bundles, renewals, term migrations.
The article mentions “Product & Pricing Model” among top migration challenges. LinkedIn
Impacts:
•	Bundles, options, features in CPQ may map differently in RCA (Offer objects, product versions).
•	Price rules, discount schedules, usage pricing may require rebuild.
•	In-flight quotes/subscriptions with legacy price rules may not have exact equivalents.
Mitigation: Document all pricing rules, build a value-map of pricing semantics, validate parity for key flows (quote → contract → renewal).
3. Data & Relationship Migration
The relationships between CPQ objects (Product ↔ Option ↔ Feature ↔ QuoteLine ↔ Subscription) and RCA objects may differ, which complicates migration of in-flight quotes, subscriptions and contracts.
Impacts:
•	Parent/child hierarchies (product options) may map differently; you risk loss of option relationships or incorrect mapping.
•	Subscriptions and contracts already live in CPQ must transition with minimal disruption.
•	Field mappings, external IDs, historical data cleansing become large tasks.
Mitigation: Build detailed mapping tables (which you are doing), preserve external IDs where possible, convert relationships with mapping tables, audit migrated data.
4. Custom Logic & Rules Re-Implementation
Many CPQ implementations include custom price rules, product rules, constraint logic, plugins (Apex), which will not necessarily transfer directly to RCA.
Impacts:
•	The business logic for pricing, bundling, discounting may need to be re-built in RCA’s rule engine (or via custom metadata).
•	Testing complexity increases as you must validate business scenarios across old and new systems.
Mitigation: Catalog all custom logic in CPQ, evaluate if equivalent exists in RCA, plan for redevelopment of logic, run regression testing on each rule subset.
5. Integration and Ecosystem Dependencies
CPQ integrations (ERP, billing, revenue recognition, external systems) may need to be revisited as RCA may require different endpoints or invocation patterns.
Impacts:
•	Downstream systems (billing schedule, invoice generation, revenue recognition) might expect CPQ-legacy tables.
•	Real-time/configuration APIs may change.
Mitigation: Review all integrations; align them to RCA data model; build interface adapters; test end-to-end flows (quote → order → invoice).
6. Legacy Data & In-Flight Transactions
Migrating active quotes, contracts, subscriptions (“in-flight”) is tricky — cannot simply bulk migrate everything without validating pricing, term, billing schedule, etc.
Impacts:
•	You’ll need to support hybrid state (some deals in CPQ, some in RCA) for a period.
•	Data cut-over risk: duplicates, mismatches, double billing.
Mitigation: Define cut-over strategy (which in-flight deals migrate, which stay), reconcile major fields (MRR, commission, renewal date), perform dual-system parallel runs.
7. Change Management & Feature Adoption
Because RCA may introduce new workflows or UI elements (catalog, offers, subscriptions), users/admins need time to adapt.
Impacts:
•	Resistance to change; risk of drop in quote velocity or errors post-go-live.
•	Training cost and ramp-up.
Mitigation: Early stakeholder communication; sandbox testing; training sessions; pilot business units; measure adoption KPIs.

🧮 Summary for Architect Review
•	Use the link list above as your master reading list for all objects, rules, and data model dimensions (pricing rules, product rules, configuration rules).
•	Build a migration readiness checklist incorporating each challenge area with owner/mitigation.
•	Align your mapping document (object-by-object) to ensure each challenge, rule set and data relation is captured.
•	Prioritize in-flight deals, pricing rules, and custom logic as high risk.
•	Plan for a dual-system phase, strong testing, and data reconciliation to ensure smooth transition.
